Chapter 2: Awakening

Stella and Emma walked silently to their Jeep, each lost in their own thoughts. The revelation from Stella's mom weighed heavily on them. As Stella turned the ignition, the familiar rumble of the engine brought her a small measure of comfort, but it did little to ease the swirling anxiety in her mind.

The drive back to their apartment was quiet, the air thick with tension and unspoken worries. Stella's hands gripped the steering wheel tightly, knuckles white, as she navigated through the familiar streets of Washington. Emma glanced at her occasionally, concern etched on her face, but she remained silent, respecting Stella’s need for space.

Finally, they pulled into the parking lot of their cozy two-bedroom apartment, located within walking distance of Illinois Central College. The building, a modest brick structure, had always felt like a safe haven, but now it seemed almost ominous, a reminder of the unknown dangers Stella faced.

Stella turned off the engine and exhaled deeply, resting her forehead on the steering wheel for a moment. “I still can’t believe all this is real,” she muttered.

Emma reached out and placed a hand on her shoulder. “We’ll figure it out, Stella. We always do. You’re not alone in this.”

Stella lifted her head and forced a smile. “Thanks, Emma. I don’t know what I’d do without you.”

They exited the Jeep and made their way up the stairs to their apartment. The familiar creak of the steps under their feet was oddly comforting. Inside, the warmth and coziness of their home contrasted sharply with the cold, hard reality of Stella’s new truth.

Stella dropped her keys on the kitchen counter and sank into the couch, feeling the weight of the day pressing down on her. Emma sat next to her, close but giving her space to process.

“You know, if anyone can handle this, it’s you,” Emma whispered, leaning in closer. “You’re strong, Stella. Stronger than you think.”

Stella sighed, glancing down at her cracked and glowing pendant. “I just… I never imagined something like this. It feels like a dream, or a nightmare. I don’t even know where to start,” she whispered back, her voice barely audible.

Emma leaned back, staring at the ceiling for a moment before whispering, “We’ll start with what your mom said. Training, learning to control your powers. One step at a time.”

“Shh,” Stella said quickly, glancing toward the hallway. “What if Lucas hears you?”

Emma nodded, lowering her voice further. “Right, sorry. We’ll be careful. But you know he’d help if he knew.”

Stella nodded, though she still felt overwhelmed. “I guess you’re right. It’s just… a lot to take in.”

Emma gave her a reassuring smile. “We’ll get through it together. And hey, at least you have a cool superpower. Not everyone can say that.”

Stella chuckled softly, appreciating Emma’s attempt to lighten the mood. “Yeah, I suppose so. Just wish it came with a manual.”

They sat in silence for a few moments longer, each lost in thought, before Stella finally stood up. “I’m going to make some tea. Want some?”

“Sure,” Emma replied, watching Stella walk to the kitchen. She could see the determination beginning to replace the fear in Stella’s eyes, and it gave her hope. They would face whatever came next, together.

As Stella stood in the kitchen, watching the water boil for tea, her thoughts drifted back to the conversation she had with her mother earlier that day. The memory replayed vividly in her mind.

Her mother had been clear: the pendant couldn’t be fixed. It had done its job for as long as it could, but now that it was cracked, its abilities were failing. Stella needed to keep wearing it to help control the power leakage, and they had to keep her powers a secret. The dangers of being a Phoenix were real and immediate; people would want to capture or harm her because of her abilities. The weight of her mother’s words still pressed heavily on her.

The sound of the kettle whistling brought Stella back to the present. She poured the hot water into two mugs and carried them to the living room, handing one to Emma.

“Thanks,” Emma said, taking a sip. “Feeling any better?”

Stella sat down, wrapping her hands around the warm mug. “A little. I was just thinking about what my mom said. About keeping this a secret and staying safe.”

Emma nodded, her voice a whisper. “It’s a lot to take in, but we’ll figure it out. One step at a time, remember?”

“Yeah,” Stella replied, taking a deep breath. “One step at a time.”

They sipped their tea in silence, letting the warmth and quiet calm them. Stella looked at Emma, seeing the concern and support in her friend’s eyes.

A few moments later, the front door opened, and Lucas walked in, his laptop bag slung over his shoulder. He paused when he saw them, sensing the heavy atmosphere.

“Hey, what’s going on?” Lucas asked, looking between them.

Stella and Emma exchanged a quick glance before Stella forced a small smile. “Nothing much, just a long day. How was yours?”

Lucas raised an eyebrow, clearly not convinced but decided not to push it. “It was okay. Worked on some coding stuff, attended a couple of classes. You know, the usual.”

He set his bag down and joined them in the living room, sitting across from Stella and Emma. He leaned back, trying to lighten the mood. “So, in one of my programming classes today, the professor tried to explain recursion. Half the class looked like they were about to have an existential crisis. One guy even asked if recursion was a type of pizza topping. We all lost it.”

Lucas chuckled at the memory, expecting to hear at least a chuckle from his friends, but he was met with silence. He looked at Stella and Emma, noticing their distant expressions.

“Uh, did I say something wrong? Or is there something I should know about?” Lucas asked, his concern growing.

Stella shook her head, trying to force a smile. “No, it’s nothing you did. We’re just… processing a lot right now.”

Emma nodded in agreement, glancing at Stella for a moment before looking back at Lucas. “Yeah, it’s just been one of those days.”

Lucas nodded slowly, his expression softening. “Alright, well, if you guys need to talk or anything, I’m here. Just let me know.”

Stella nodded, grateful for his offer but unsure how much she could share. “Thanks, Lucas. We appreciate it.”

They continued to sip their tea, the silence slowly becoming more comfortable with Lucas's presence. Despite everything that had happened, there was a small comfort in the normalcy of their evening routine.

The next morning, Stella woke up feeling a strange, pulsing warmth emanating from her chest. She rubbed her eyes, glancing at the clock and realizing it was earlier than she intended to wake up. Unable to fall back asleep, she decided to get up and make breakfast.

Stella quietly moved to the kitchen, not wanting to wake Emma or Lucas. She caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror: her long, wavy black hair was a tangled mess, and she wore an oversized, worn-out T-shirt that slipped off one shoulder, revealing a hint of her collarbone. The shirt was just long enough to cover her underwear, giving a modest yet relaxed look. Her long legs felt the coolness of the floor as she padded barefoot across the apartment.

The apartment was silent, and she hoped the routine of cooking would help distract her from the unsettling warmth in her chest. As she cracked eggs into a bowl and started whisking, she tried to focus on the task at hand. The familiar sounds and smells of breakfast usually comforted her, but today, the warmth was a constant distraction.

Suddenly, a surge of heat coursed through her body. She gasped, feeling a burning sensation in her fingertips. Before she could react, a burst of flames shot out from her hands, igniting the frying pan in front of her.

“Ah!” Stella cried out, stumbling back in shock, her heart racing.

Lucas, hearing the commotion, rushed into the kitchen. “Stella, what’s going on?” he exclaimed, eyes wide as he saw the flames licking the air.

He quickly grabbed a fire extinguisher from under the sink and aimed it at the pan, releasing a burst of foam that smothered the fire. Just as the flames were extinguished, Emma came running in, alarmed by the noise.

“Stella, are you okay?” Emma asked, her voice filled with concern as she took in the scene, her eyes scanning Stella for any injuries.

Stella stood there, staring at the charred remains in the frying pan, her heart pounding. “I… I must have left the burner on too high,” she stammered, trying to cover up the truth, her hands still trembling. The lie tasted bitter on her tongue, but what else could she say?

Lucas, attempting to lighten the mood, gave a nervous chuckle. “Well, I guess we know who won’t be winning any cooking competitions anytime soon.”

Emma shot him a sharp look, her eyes flashing with irritation. “Lucas, this is serious! Can’t you see she’s upset?”

Lucas’s expression turned serious as he looked back at Stella. “I'm sorry, Stella. Are you sure you're okay?”

Stella nodded, though her hands were still trembling. “Yeah, I think so. Just a little shaken up.”

Emma wrapped an arm around Stella's shoulders, guiding her to sit down at the kitchen table. “You need to sit and relax for a minute.”

Stella sank into the chair, trying to calm her racing heart. Emma handed her a glass of water, which she gratefully accepted. The cool liquid soothed her dry throat, but her mind was still racing.

Lucas finished cleaning up the mess from the fire extinguisher, glancing back at Stella every few moments with concern. He put the fire extinguisher back under the sink and walked over to sit down at the table with them.

Emma squeezed Stella's hand reassuringly. “We need to be more careful. This could have been a lot worse.”

Stella nodded, feeling tears prickling at the corners of her eyes. She leaned closer to Emma, her voice barely above a whisper, “I know. I just... I just don't know how to control it.” The words felt heavy, the fear of her uncontrollable powers weighing on her.

Emma's eyes softened. “We'll figure it out together. One step at a time.”

Lucas, trying to ease the tension, added, “Maybe we should all take it easy today. No more surprises.”

Stella took a deep breath and nodded. “Yeah, that's probably a good idea.”

Lucas, satisfied with their responses, got up. “I'll give you both some space and get ready for my classes,” he said, leaving the kitchen to prepare for his day.

Once Lucas was out of earshot, Emma turned to Stella with a more serious expression. “Stella, I think you need to practice controlling your... situation. Maybe we should go to the woods where it's safe. I’ll help as much as I can.”

Stella looked up, hope flickering in her eyes. “Do you really think that will work?”

Emma nodded confidently. “It’s worth a try. We need to find a way for you to manage it. The woods are secluded; it’s the perfect place to practice.”

Stella sighed, feeling a mix of fear and relief. “Okay. Let’s do it.”

As they settled into a more comfortable conversation, the incident lingered in their minds. Stella knew she had to find a way to control her powers, not just for her safety, but for the safety of those she cared about. The support of her friends gave her a glimmer of hope, even as the reality of her situation loomed large.

Stella retreated to her room, her mind swirling with the morning’s events. She needed guidance, and she knew only one person who could provide it. Taking a deep breath, she dialed her mother’s number. The phone rang a few times before her mother’s concerned voice came through.

“Stella, is everything alright?”

“Mom, something happened this morning. I… I lost control,” Stella said, her voice trembling.

“What do you mean?” her mother asked, her tone becoming more serious.

“I was making breakfast, and suddenly flames shot out of my hands. I almost set the kitchen on fire,” Stella explained, tears welling up in her eyes.

Her mother sighed deeply. “Stella, remember what we talked about. Your powers are tied to your emotions. The more calm and centered you are, the better you can manage them. This is why the exercises are so important.”

“I know, Mom, but it’s hard. I was just making breakfast, and suddenly everything went wrong,” Stella said, frustration and fear mingling in her voice.

“Maybe you should consider taking a break from college until you get this under control. It’s too dangerous,” her mother suggested, her voice filled with concern.

“No, Mom! I can’t just quit college. My life is here, and I’ve worked so hard to get this far,” Stella replied, her voice rising with determination.

“I understand, but your safety is more important than anything else. If something were to happen…” her mother trailed off, the fear evident in her voice.

“I’ll manage, Mom. I’ll do the exercises, and I’ll be careful. But I can’t just give up everything,” Stella insisted, tears of frustration streaming down her face.

“Alright, but promise me you’ll take this seriously. Practice the exercises every day and call me if anything else happens,” her mother finally relented.

“I promise, Mom. I’ll be careful,” Stella said, her voice softening.

“Stay strong, Stella. You can do this. One step at a time,” her mother reassured her.

After the call ended, Stella took a deep breath and rejoined Emma in the living room, her resolve firm.

Emma looked up, concern etched on her face. “How did it go?”

“Mom reminded me about the exercises,” Stella began, her voice shaking with suppressed emotion. “But then she suggested I take a break from college. I can't believe she even suggested that. She knows how much this means to me.”

Emma's eyes widened in surprise. “She wants you to quit college?”

Stella nodded, tears welling up again. “Yeah, but I told her I couldn’t do that. I need to find a way to manage this while keeping my life intact.”

Emma wrapped her arms around Stella in a comforting hug. Just as Stella started crying, Lucas walked in.

“Hey, have you guys seen my—” Lucas began, then stopped awkwardly when he saw Stella crying. He stood there for a moment, unsure of what to do. “Uh, I’ll just… look somewhere else,” he mumbled, slowly backing out of the room.

Emma pulled back, looking Stella in the eyes. “We’ll figure this out together. You’re not alone in this.”

Stella felt a wave of gratitude for her friend’s unwavering support. “Thanks, Emma. That means a lot.”

After a brief moment, Emma suggested, “Why don’t we go out to the woods and start practicing now? If you’re feeling up for it.”

Stella wiped her tears and took a deep breath. “Yeah, I think that’s a good idea. Let’s do it.”

Emma nodded, giving her a reassuring smile. “Alright, let’s get ready and head out.”

Stella and Emma headed to their shared room to change, knowing they needed comfortable clothes for their training session. Stella walked in first, glancing at herself in the mirror. Her eyes lingered on the oversized T-shirt that slipped off one shoulder, revealing the curve of her collarbone, and her lacy underwear. She sighed and began to undress, feeling the cool air on her skin. The soft, lacy material of her underwear contrasted with the firmness of her toned legs.

She rummaged through her drawer, pulling out a pair of black leggings that hugged her curves perfectly. The material was snug and stretchy, ideal for movement. She then chose a dark green tank top that accentuated her figure and contrasted nicely with her hair. Finally, she threw on a lightweight hoodie for some added warmth, zipping it up halfway to reveal a hint of her tank top. She tied her hair back into a high ponytail, making sure it was secure.

Emma followed suit, peeling off her worn-out T-shirt. As she turned around, Stella’s eyes were drawn to the earthy tribal tattoo that covered a significant portion of Emma’s back. The tattoo was intricate, with a large, majestic tree as the centerpiece. The roots of the tree extended downward, entwining with what looked like a language Stella had never seen before, forming elegant, flowing characters.

“Emma, I’ve been meaning to ask you about that tattoo,” Stella said, her curiosity finally getting the better of her. “It looks really intricate and special. What does it mean? Is it in Japanese or something?”

Emma stiffened slightly before shrugging casually. “Oh, this? It’s just something I thought looked cool. Nothing special,” she said, slipping on a simple blue T-shirt that fit snugly over her chest.

Stella sensed there was more to it but decided not to press further. Instead, she focused on getting ready. Emma pulled on a pair of grey yoga pants that clung to her hips and slipped on her favorite pair of running shoes. She grabbed a sweatshirt, just in case it got colder later. Her hair was already tied up in a neat bun, ready for action.

Once they were both dressed, they grabbed a few essentials. Stella picked up a couple of water bottles and a small towel. Emma gathered some snacks, a first aid kit, and a blanket to sit on.

“Ready?” Emma asked, looking at Stella with determination.

Stella nodded, feeling more prepared. “Ready.”

They headed out to a secluded area in the woods, right on the edge of the campus. The woods were quiet, with only the sounds of birds and rustling leaves to accompany them. The trees stood tall and thick, their canopies forming a natural shield that made the area feel isolated and secure. The sunlight filtered through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor.

As they walked deeper into the woods, Stella noticed how at ease Emma seemed. She moved gracefully, her steps light and confident, as if the forest was her natural habitat. Stella couldn’t help but feel a bit envious of her friend’s ease and comfort in nature.

“Alright, let’s start with the exercises your mom suggested,” Emma said, setting down the blanket for them to sit on. She spread it out carefully, ensuring there was enough space for both of them to sit comfortably.

Stella nodded, taking a deep breath as she tried to recall her mother’s instructions. “Okay. She said to start by focusing on my breathing, to find a sense of calm.”

Emma watched as Stella closed her eyes and began to breathe deeply, her hands resting on her knees. The air around them was crisp and fresh, filled with the scent of pine and earth. The warmth of the pendant seemed to pulse in time with her breaths, gradually becoming more manageable.

After a few minutes, Stella opened her eyes and gave Emma a small, unsure smile. “I think it’s working. I feel a little more in control,” she said, noticing the pendant dimming slightly, a sign that she was gaining more mastery over her powers.

Emma smiled back, relieved. “That’s great! Let’s keep going.”

They continued with the exercises, Stella focusing on controlling her emotions and channeling her powers in a safe manner. The training was difficult and exhausting, but Stella felt a growing sense of confidence with each passing moment. They practiced different techniques her mother had taught her, each one designed to help her manage her powers more effectively.

“Okay, now try to summon a small flame in the palm of your hand and keep it steady like what your mom did,” Emma instructed.

Stella held out her hand, her palm open and facing upward. She closed her eyes, concentrating on the warmth she felt within. Slowly, a small flame appeared in the center of her palm, flickering softly. She focused on keeping it steady, her breath matching the rhythm of the flame.

The flame felt almost unbearably hot, searing her skin when she struggled to control it. Her mind raced with thoughts of failure and fear. What if she never learned to control this? What if she hurt someone? The flame in her palm sputtered and flared, reflecting her inner turmoil.

“Remember, stay calm,” Emma encouraged, her voice steady and soothing.

Stella took a deep breath, trying to focus. Gradually, the flame steadied, its color shifting to a calm blue. She felt a moment of triumph, the warmth now comfortable and almost soothing.

Just then, Stella suddenly felt a chill run down her spine. The flame in her palm pulsed red and then extinguished as she glanced around, her senses on high alert. “Emma, do you feel that? Like we’re being watched?”

Emma looked around as well, her expression turning serious. “Yeah, I do. But I don’t see anyone.”

Just then, Stella noticed a figure in the distance, partially obscured by the trees. She squinted, trying to make out who it was. Her heart skipped a beat. “Oh no,” Stella whispered, her voice filled with confusion and fear. “Is that... Madison? Is she recording us?”

Emma’s eyes widened in alarm. “This is bad. We need to get out of here.”

They quickly gathered their things and hurried out of the woods, the weight of the new threat hanging over them. Stella knew that keeping her powers a secret had just become much more complicated.

As they made their way back to the apartment, Stella couldn’t shake the feeling that Madison’s recording would lead to even greater challenges ahead. They discussed the implications of Madison's actions and the need to be even more careful in the future.

Once back at the apartment, the two sat down at the kitchen table, the weight of the day pressing on them. Emma glanced at Stella, noticing her anxious expression.

“Stella, we need to come up with a plan to handle Madison,” Emma said, her voice calm but firm.

Stella nodded, her mind racing with possibilities. “You’re right. We can’t let her show that video to anyone. If people find out about my powers, it could be disastrous.”

Emma leaned forward, her expression serious. “We need to figure out how to get that recording from her. Maybe we can reason with her?”

Stella shook her head, her frustration evident. “Madison isn’t exactly the reasonable type. She loves drama and attention. She might see this as her big break.”

Emma sighed, rubbing her temples. “We’ll need a plan. Something that can convince her to give us the recording without causing more trouble.”

Just then, Lucas walked in, fresh from his classes. He looked between Stella and Emma, sensing the tension. “What’s going on now?”

Stella and Emma exchanged a quick glance. Stella forced a smile. “Nothing, Lucas. Just... girl stuff.”

Lucas raised an eyebrow but didn’t push further. “Alright, if you say so. Just let me know if you need anything.”

“No, wait,” Stella said with a sigh. “Lucas, we actually do need your help. But you have to promise to keep this between us.”

Lucas looked intrigued and slightly concerned. “Alright, I promise. What’s going on?”

Stella took a deep breath, steeling herself for what she was about to say. "Madison... she has something on us. And if she shares it, it could ruin everything."

Lucas’s eyes widened in surprise and concern. “What do you mean?”

Emma leaned in, her voice low and urgent. “We need your tech skills, Lucas. This has to stay between us. Can you help us out?”

The weight of their request hung in the air, the tension palpable as they waited for Lucas’s response. He looked at both of them, his mind clearly racing. “Okay,” he said finally. “Tell me everything.”
