Write your chapter content here using regular Markdown. You can keep everything exactly as you do today—headings, paragraphs, quotes, code blocks, images, and so on.

Because this file uses the `chapter` layout, the [Previous] and [Next] links at the bottom are rendered for you. Just update the `prev_url` and `next_url` values whenever you add or reorder chapters.
