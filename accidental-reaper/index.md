# ⚰️ The Accidental Reaper

A college graduate dies early thanks to a reaper’s paperwork mistake, the reaper department hires him as their newest employee.
Now death is his 9-to-5 job: guiding souls to the afterlife and dealing with the ones who refuse to go.

He’s assigned a strict, oddly protective trainer who seems to know more than she should.
Meanwhile, he starts noticing strange inconsistencies in the world around him… and in himself.

As he adjusts to reaper life, hidden powers, buried secrets, and cosmic forces begin to close in.

_Coming soon. Chapters for **The Accidental Reaper** will appear here.
