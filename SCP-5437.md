# SCP-5437 Dossier

\*\*Item \#:\*\* SCP-5437

\*\*Object Class:\*\* Euclid

\*\*Special Containment Procedures:\*\* SCP-5437 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-33. Interaction with SCP-5437 is only permitted with the approval of a Level 3 researcher and under surveillance by security personnel. Personnel exhibiting signs of emotional attraction towards SCP-5437 or a history of intense romantic relationships are barred from interacting with SCP-5437.

Any staff member developing an obsessive interest in SCP-5437 or displaying any behavioral change after interaction must be reported to Site-33's psychiatric department immediately. They are to be quarantined and administered a Class-B amnestic until further notice.

\*\*Description:\*\* SCP-5437 is a humanoid entity of Japanese descent, appearing to be a young woman in her early twenties. SCP-5437 exhibits standard physical attributes expected of a non-anomalous human of her approximate age and physical condition. The exception is that when she develops romantic feelings towards an individual, referred to as SCP-5437-1, a series of anomalous effects take place.

SCP-5437 is capable of inducing a psychological effect on any individual she designates as SCP-5437-1, irrespective of the target's initial feelings towards her. This typically results in SCP-5437-1 reciprocating SCP-5437's feelings, becoming emotionally dependent on her, developing an obsession with her comparable to SCP-5437's own obsession, and demonstrating an overwhelming desire to ensure her safety at all costs.

After seven days of continuous exposure to SCP-5437, SCP-5437-1 instances develop an intense need to remain within her line of sight. The longer they are separated from SCP-5437, the more frantic they become, often displaying above-human strength in their attempts to reunite with her. SCP-5437-1 instances always seem to know the direction of SCP-5437, regardless of distance or obstacles.

Moreover, SCP-5437-1 instances gain anomalous regenerative abilities, capable of healing from injuries at an accelerated rate. Despite the rapid healing, they still experience the full pain of their injuries. Interestingly, SCP-5437-1 instances often perceive this pain positively, seeing it as a form of sacrifice or proof of love for SCP-5437.

\*\*Addendum 5437-01:\*\* Capture and Initial Containment

SCP-5437 was first identified in Japan following a spate of missing person reports where victims would obsessively reference a ██████ (later identified as SCP-5437) before disappearing under mysterious circumstances. Foundation personnel embedded within local law enforcement recognized the potential anomalous activity and escalated the matter to Site-33. A Mobile Task Force was dispatched to the last known location of the most recent victim.

Upon arrival, the MTF discovered SCP-5437 and her current SCP-5437-1 instance in a secluded house. SCP-5437 was speaking softly to the male individual, who was heavily injured but insisted he had never been happier. When the MTF attempted to separate the two, both SCP-5437 and SCP-5437-1 instance exhibited hostility and resistance.

The team was ultimately able to subdue SCP-5437 and the SCP-5437-1 instance, using a combination of non-lethal force and a Class-B amnestic. SCP-5437 was contained and transported to Site-33 for further analysis.

\*\*Addendum 5437-02:\*\* Incident Log

Incident 5437-A: After several interviews with SCP-5437, Dr. ██████ began to display symptoms indicative of becoming an SCP-5437-1 instance. Despite being critically injured during an altercation with another researcher, Dr. ██████ displayed remarkable regenerative abilities. He was subsequently treated with a Class-B amnestic and re-assigned to a different project.

Incident 5437-B: During a scheduled experiment, D-8751 was introduced to SCP-5437. Over the course of six days, D-8751's behavior became progressively more erratic. On the seventh day, D-8751 attacked another D-class personnel after a casual remark towards SCP-5437. D-8751 exhibited heightened protective response and anomalous regenerative abilities. He was treated with a Class-B amnestic.

\*\*Case Study 5437-1B:\*\* Dr. ██████, upon becoming an SCP-5437-1 instance, attempted to free SCP-5437 from containment, stating that she "deserved to be free and loved". His attempt was unsuccessful, and he was administered a Class-B amnestic.

Incident 5437-C: During a containment breach of SCP-████, SCP-5437 escaped her containment cell and crossed paths with Agent ███████. In the following hours, Agent ███████ displayed a strong protective instinct towards SCP-5437 and attacked fellow agents trying to reestablish containment. Despite being seriously injured, Agent ███████ exhibited abnormal healing properties. SCP-5437 was recontained without further incident.

Incident 5437-D: SCP-5437-1 instance D-8751, after seven days of exposure to SCP-5437, displayed extreme distress when removed from her presence for a routine medical examination. D-8751 became increasingly frantic and eventually displayed above-human strength, breaking through the examination room door in an attempt to return to SCP-5437. D-8751 was subdued and treated with a Class-B amnestic. Further testing confirmed that SCP-5437-1 instances develop an intense need to remain within SCP-5437's line of sight after seven days of continuous exposure.

\*\*Addendum 5437-07:\*\* Interview Log 5437-J

Interviewed: SCP-5437

Interviewer: Dr. ██████

Foreword: This interview was conducted to gain a better understanding of SCP-5437's cognizance of her abilities, her control over these effects, and her feelings towards the individuals affected.

\<Begin Log\>

Dr. ██████: "Do you understand the effects you have on people?"

SCP-5437: "Of course I do. I love them, and they love me back."

Dr. ██████: "But they get hurt. Do you realize that?"

SCP-5437: "Love can be painful sometimes. They accept the pain because they love me, just as I am willing to accept pain for them."

Dr. ██████: "Do you have any control over these effects? Can you stop them if you want to?"

SCP-5437: "It's not something I control. It's just... a part of who I am. I don't think I can stop it."

Dr. ██████: "And how do you feel about the individuals who become SCP-5437-1? Do you feel any guilt over their pain?"

SCP-5437: "Guilt? No. They choose to accept the pain. They see it as a proof of their love. And in their love, I find my joy."

Dr. ██████: "But they don't have a choice, do they? Your influence forces them to feel this way."

SCP-5437: (Her tone sharpens noticeably) "You have no right to accuse me of such things\! It's not force. It's love\!"

Dr. ██████: "Is it love, though, when they're in pain, when they're suffering because of you?"

SCP-5437: (Becoming visibly agitated, shouting) "How dare you?\! You're twisting my words, trying to paint me as a monster\! Love isn't a simple, sterile thing you can dissect and analyze\!"

Dr. ██████: "I'm merely trying to understand your perspective, SCP-5437."

SCP-5437: (Slamming her hands on the table, screaming) "Enough\! You know nothing about love, about sacrifice, about pain\! You're just a cold observer hiding behind your clipboard\!"

\<End Log\>

Closing Statement: The interview was terminated following SCP-5437's outburst. Her uncharacteristic display of intense aggression and potential psychopathy adds a new dimension to our understanding of her psychological state and highlights the inherent danger she presents. SCP-5437 was returned to her containment cell without further incident. An increased level of caution is to be exercised in future interactions with SCP-5437. A proposal for revising SCP-5437's containment protocol to include measures for handling potential emotional volatility is under review. Further psychological evaluation of SCP-5437 is recommended.

\*\*Addendum 5437-9: Experiment Log 5437-1\*\*

\*\*Experiment 5437-1A: Separation Test\*\*

\*\*Subject:\*\* D-8751 (SCP-5437-1 instance) and SCP-5437

\*\*Procedure:\*\* D-8751 and SCP-5437 were separated and placed in separate containment cells. Both subjects were monitored for any changes in behavior or physical condition.

\*\*Results:\*\* During the separation period, both D-8751 and SCP-5437 displayed signs of distress and anxiety. D-8751 became increasingly agitated and restless after approximately 12 hours of separation. He exhibited above-human strength and attempted to escape the containment cell to reunite with SCP-5437. SCP-5437, in her cell, showed signs of restlessness and repeatedly attempted to approach the containment door facing D-8751's cell.

After 24 hours, both D-8751 and SCP-5437 exhibited heightened distress. D-8751's attempts to escape intensified, and SCP-5437 was observed pressing against the containment door, attempting to find a line of sight to D-8751's cell. Both subjects' vital signs showed increased heart rate and stress responses.

Due to concerns over the potential psychological and physical harm to both subjects, the separation test was terminated at the 24-hour mark, and D-8751 was returned to SCP-5437's presence. Upon reuniting, both subjects immediately showed signs of relief and calmed down.

\*\*Note:\*\* The separation test confirms that both SCP-5437 and SCP-5437-1 experience distress and a strong desire to be in each other's presence when separated. The emotional bond between them appears to trigger mutual anxiety and the need for physical proximity. Further study is recommended to understand the extent and nature of this bond.

\*\*Experiment 5437-1B: Enhanced Abilities Test\*\*

\*\*Subject:\*\* D-8751 (SCP-5437-1 instance)

\*\*Procedure:\*\* D-8751 was subjected to a series of physical tests to measure strength, speed, and regenerative capabilities.

\*\*Results:\*\* D-8751 displayed a progressive increase in physical abilities with each passing day of exposure to SCP-5437. The subject's strength, speed, and regenerative capabilities increased significantly, with the most notable improvement being in the rate of regeneration. D-8751 was able to heal from serious injuries within hours, and minor injuries almost instantaneously.

\*\*Experiment 5437-1C: Lethality Test\*\*

\*\*Subject:\*\* D-8751 (SCP-5437-1 instance)

\*\*Procedure:\*\* D-8751 was subjected to a series of potentially lethal injuries to determine the limits of the subject's regenerative capabilities.

\*\*Results:\*\* D-8751 was able to survive and recover from injuries that would normally be fatal to a non-anomalous human. However, the subject still experienced the full pain of these injuries. The subject's regenerative capabilities did not seem to extend to injuries that caused immediate death, such as severe brain trauma.

\*\*Experiment 5437-1D: Amnestic Test\*\*

\*\*Subject:\*\* D-8751 (SCP-5437-1 instance)

\*\*Procedure:\*\* D-8751 was administered a Class-B amnestic to observe the effect on the subject's anomalous properties.

\*\*Results:\*\* Following the administration of the Class-B amnestic, D-8751's anomalous properties ceased. The subject no longer displayed enhanced physical abilities or regenerative capabilities. The subject also no longer exhibited a compulsion to remain within SCP-5437's line of sight or protect her at all costs. The subject retained no memory of SCP-5437 or the events that occurred while under her influence.

\*\*Note:\*\* The results of these experiments confirm that SCP-5437-1 instances lose all anomalous properties after being administered a Class-B amnestic. This provides a viable method for neutralizing SCP-5437's influence in emergency situations. However, the psychological impact on SCP-5437-1 instances following the loss of their anomalous properties requires further study.

\*\*Addendum 5437-10:\*\* Research Updates

Ongoing research into SCP-5437's anomalous properties is currently being conducted under the supervision of Dr. ██████. The goal is to better understand the nature of SCP-5437's abilities and find a way to counteract her influence, if possible. The studies are also focused on investigating the exact mechanism behind the induced regenerative properties in SCP-5437-1 instances, as well as exploring potential applications for the anomalous healing factor.

\*\*Closing Statement:\*\* The potential for psychological and

 physical harm presented by SCP-5437 requires strict adherence to containment protocols and continued research into her anomalous effects. Staff members are reminded to stay vigilant and report any unusual behavior immediately.
