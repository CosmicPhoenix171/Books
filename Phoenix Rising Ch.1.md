**Chapter 1 \- Awakening** 

Stella Aurelia Ignis sighed as she glanced around her dorm room. Posters of her favorite bands adorned the walls, and a stack of textbooks lay haphazardly on her desk, reminding her of the impending exams. She ran a hand through her long, wavy black hair, the auburn highlights catching the sunlight streaming through the window. The Phoenix-shaped pendant around her neck rested warmly against her skin, a constant, comforting presence.

Across the room, Emma stretched and yawned, her short, bright blue hair a stark contrast to her light olive skin. Emma's petite frame stood at just over five feet tall, with a graceful, almost ethereal quality to her movements. Her large, expressive green eyes were always alive with curiosity and mischief. Emma’s smooth skin had a healthy glow, accentuated by her simple white tank top and snug underwear, which clung to her slim form and highlighted her natural curves.

Stella, similarly dressed in a matching set of black lace underwear, stood up and stretched. She stood at about five foot seven, her long, wavy black hair cascading down her back with auburn highlights shimmering in the sunlight. Her fair skin had a slight golden undertone, giving her a healthy glow. Stella’s amber eyes were striking against her pale complexion, often reflecting her intense emotions and thoughts. She had a slender, athletic build, a result of her dedication to morning runs and yoga sessions, which defined her muscles and gave her a graceful yet strong appearance. Her long legs and toned arms were accentuated by her posture, always carrying herself with an air of quiet confidence.

“Ready for another thrilling day of academia?” Emma asked, her voice dripping with sarcasm as she sat up on her bed, swinging her legs over the side and resting her elbows on her knees.

“As ready as I’ll ever be,” Stella replied, chuckling. “Let’s just hope I don’t embarrass myself in front of Professor Thompson again.”

Before Emma could respond, the door burst open, and Lucas barreled in, laptop in hand. “Guys, you have to see this\! I made a breakthrough in the program I’ve been working on—”

His words were cut short as both girls shrieked in unison. “Lucas\! Get out\!” they yelled, grabbing pillows and anything within reach to throw at him.

Lucas, standing at 5'9" with his mop of tousled brown hair and hazel eyes wide with surprise, scrambled to cover his eyes. He had a wiry frame that suggested a mix of nerdy charm and hidden athleticism. “I swear I don’t see anything\!” he exclaimed, almost dropping his laptop as he tried to cover his eyes and back out of the room quickly, narrowly avoiding a flying textbook. His T-shirt, adorned with a Windows 95 logo, flapped as he made his hasty retreat, clutching his laptop protectively.

The door slammed shut behind him, leaving the girls in a mix of embarrassment and laughter.

“That boy has no sense of privacy,” Emma muttered, shaking her head, her green eyes rolling dramatically.

Stella, still laughing, glanced at her Phoenix pendant, feeling its reassuring warmth. She pushed aside the strange sensation she’d felt earlier, focusing instead on getting dressed and ready for the day ahead.

Stella and Emma quickly dressed, exchanging amused glances at Lucas’s hasty retreat. Stella opted for a pair of fitted jeans and a soft, off-the-shoulder sweater that complemented her hair. She slipped on her favorite boots and, after a moment’s hesitation, tucked the Phoenix pendant under her sweater, feeling its comforting weight against her skin.

Emma, meanwhile, chose a colorful skirt and a simple blouse, pairing them with ankle boots. Her bright blue hair stood out vibrantly against the more subdued tones of her outfit.

“Ready to face the day?” Stella asked, grabbing her bag and checking her reflection in the mirror one last time.

“Always,” Emma replied with a grin, stuffing her sketchbook into her tote bag. “And I’m pretty sure Lucas will think twice before barging in unannounced again.”

They left their bedroom and walked into the living room, where they found Lucas sitting on the couch, furiously typing on his laptop. His face turned a deep shade of red when he glanced up and saw them fully dressed.

“Sorry about earlier,” he mumbled, looking down in embarrassment. “I got excited.”

Emma, still cranky from the morning’s surprise, shot Lucas a glare. “Next time, knock, pervert,” she muttered.

Stella walked over to Lucas, curiosity piqued. “So, what’s this breakthrough you’re so excited about?” she asked, peering at his laptop screen.

Lucas brightened up immediately, the embarrassment fading from his face. “I finally cracked the code I was working on for that AI project. It can now predict user behavior with 90% accuracy\! I was testing it all night, and it’s working perfectly.”

“That’s amazing, Lucas\!” Stella said, genuinely impressed. “But seriously, if you really wanted to peek that badly, all you had to do was ask,” she added with a teasing smile to ensure he knew it was a joke.

Lucas chuckled, rubbing the back of his neck. “Yeah, I was just really excited. I’ll definitely knock next time, promise.”

Emma chimed in from the doorway, “Hey, if you get rich and famous, don’t forget about us little people.”

Lucas laughed. “I could never forget you guys. You’ve always helped keep me inspired.”

Stella gave Lucas a playful shove. “Alright, genius, we’ve got to get to class. Keep us posted on your progress.”

“Will do,” Lucas said, giving them a wave as they headed out the door.

Stella and Emma left their cozy two-bedroom apartment, located within walking distance of Illinois Central College (ICC), and strolled across the bustling campus. The quiet town of Washington, where they had lived most of their lives, was a place they both knew well. The morning sun cast long shadows on the pathways, and students hurried past, some engrossed in conversation, others with their faces buried in their phones. Stella couldn’t help but feel a strange sense of anticipation, though she couldn’t quite pinpoint why.

Their first class of the day was history, and they took their usual seats near the back. Professor Thompson, a stern but fair man with a penchant for dramatic storytelling, was already setting up his materials. Stella found herself tuning out the usual pre-class chatter, her thoughts drifting back to the odd warmth of her pendant that morning.

The lecture began, and Stella did her best to focus on the professor’s words. He was detailing the rise and fall of ancient civilizations, his voice rising and falling with practiced emphasis. But Stella’s mind kept wandering. She absentmindedly fiddled with the pendant, feeling the faint pulse of warmth again, stronger this time. She glanced around to see if anyone else noticed, but everyone was absorbed in the lecture.

Emma nudged her with a pencil. “You okay?”

“Yeah,” Stella whispered back, forcing a smile. “Just distracted.”

“Well, snap out of it. You don’t want to miss the part about the secret societies. It’s the best bit.”

Stella nodded and tried to refocus. Secret societies had always fascinated her, with their hidden agendas and mysterious rituals. As Professor Thompson delved into tales of ancient cults and lost knowledge, Stella’s curiosity piqued. She made a mental note to do some extra reading on the topic later.

As the lecture continued, Stella noticed Madison and her entourage sitting a few rows ahead. Madison’s perfect posture and attentiveness were almost too good to be true, as if she were playing a part in a carefully scripted play. Stella couldn’t help but wonder what secrets Madison might be hiding beneath her polished exterior.

The class eventually ended, and as they packed up their things, Emma leaned in closer. “Are you sure you’re okay? You seem really out of it today.”

Stella hesitated, then nodded. “Yeah, I’m fine. Just a weird morning, I guess.”

Emma gave her a scrutinizing look but didn’t press further. They exited the classroom and headed to their next class, the anticipation Stella had felt earlier now mingling with a growing sense of unease. She clutched her pendant through her sweater, hoping its warmth would soothe her nerves.

As Stella and Emma made their way to their next class, they walked through the tree-lined pathways. The campus, with its mix of historic and modern buildings, buzzed with the energy of students rushing between lectures, study groups, and social gatherings.

“What’s next on our agenda?” Emma asked, glancing at Stella.

“Philosophy,” Stella replied. “We should get there early. Professor Martin hates it when people are late.”

“Ugh, philosophy,” Emma groaned. “Why did I sign up for this class again?”

“Because you thought it would be an easy A,” Stella teased.

“Right, I must have been out of my mind,” Emma said, shaking her head.

They arrived at the lecture hall and found seats near the middle, giving them a good view of both the professor and the door. As they settled in, Stella couldn’t shake the feeling of unease that had been growing since the morning. She clutched her pendant through her sweater, feeling its warmth but also the faint pulse of energy that seemed to be increasing.

“Hey, you sure you’re okay?” Emma asked, noticing Stella’s distracted expression.

“Yeah, just... I don’t know. I’ve been feeling weird all morning,” Stella admitted.

“Well, if you need to talk about it, I’m here,” Emma said, giving her a reassuring smile.

“Thanks,” Stella replied, trying to focus on the class as Professor Martin began his lecture on existentialism.

As Professor Martin's voice droned on about existentialism, Stella's thoughts drifted again. She glanced around the room, her eyes landing on Madison, who was sitting a few rows ahead. Madison was the epitome of perfection: tall, with flawlessly styled blonde hair, always dressed in the latest fashion. She came from a wealthy family and never let anyone forget it. Stella couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy at how effortlessly composed Madison always appeared. Madison had made it a point to look down on her and Emma ever since they started at ICC.

The class eventually ended, and as they packed up their things, Madison and her entourage approached Stella and Emma.

“Well, if it isn’t the scholarship squad,” Madison sneered, her voice dripping with disdain. “How’s that free ride treating you?”

Stella felt a surge of irritation but forced a smile. “Morning, Madison.”

Madison’s eyes flicked to the Phoenix pendant around Stella’s neck. “Nice trinket,” she said dismissively. “Looks like something you’d find at a garage sale.”

Stella’s hand instinctively went to the pendant, feeling its reassuring warmth. She glared at Madison, her voice steady but with an edge. “At least I don’t need expensive jewelry to feel important.”

Madison smirked. “Just trying to be helpful. Wouldn’t want you embarrassing yourself more than usual.”

Emma stepped in, her eyes flashing with anger. “Why don’t you mind your own business, Madison?”

Madison laughed. “Touchy, aren’t we? Just don’t get too comfortable. That free ride won’t last forever.”

Stella took a deep breath, trying to keep her emotions in check. The pendant grew warmer, responding to her rising anger. “We’ll be fine, Madison. Don’t worry about us.” As she said this, a faint cracking sound came from the pendant, making her heart skip a beat.

Madison rolled her eyes and walked away with her entourage, leaving Stella and Emma standing there, fuming.

“Don’t let her get to you,” Emma said, squeezing Stella’s arm. “She’s not worth it.”

“I know,” Stella replied, exhaling slowly. “It’s just... she always knows how to push my buttons.”

Emma nodded. “Come on, let’s get to our next class before we’re late.”

As they walked, the warmth of the pendant seemed to subside slightly, but Stella could still feel the underlying pulse of energy.

Stella and Emma made their way to the science building and entered their biology lab, taking their usual seats at the back. The lab was filled with various scientific equipment, and the air smelled faintly of chemicals and freshly printed handouts. Stella’s mind wandered as she absentmindedly fiddled with her pendant, feeling the warmth and the faint pulse that had become a constant presence.

Professor Hendricks, a tall man with a mop of gray hair and thick glasses, began the class with his usual enthusiasm. “Today, we’ll be discussing cellular respiration. Make sure you’ve reviewed the chapter because we’re diving straight into the details.”

As the lecture progressed, Stella tried to focus, but the persistent warmth of her pendant kept distracting her. She glanced at Emma, who was diligently taking notes, and envied her ability to concentrate.

Halfway through the class, Stella felt a sharp, sudden pain in her chest. She gasped, clutching the pendant tightly as it grew hotter against her skin. The faint crack she had heard earlier seemed to intensify, and a thin, glowing line appeared across the pendant’s surface.

Emma noticed her friend’s distress immediately. “Stella, what’s wrong?” she whispered urgently.

“I... I don’t know,” Stella managed to say, her voice strained. “Something’s happening with the pendant.”

Emma’s eyes widened in concern. “Do you need to see the nurse?”

“No, I think I just need some fresh air,” Stella replied, struggling to keep her voice steady.

Emma quickly raised her hand to get Professor Hendricks’ attention. “Professor, may I take Stella outside? She’s not feeling well.”

Professor Hendricks looked up from his notes, his expression annoyed. “Can it wait?” he asked, his tone impatient.

“No, Professor,” Emma insisted. “It’s really urgent.”

With a sigh, Professor Hendricks nodded. “Fine, go ahead. Just don’t take too long.”

Emma helped Stella gather her things, and they left the lab, stepping into the crisp, cool air outside. Stella took a deep breath, hoping it would help calm the storm of energy inside her.

“Let’s sit over there,” Emma suggested, pointing to a bench under a large oak tree.

They sat down, and Stella tried to compose herself. The warmth of the pendant had subsided slightly, but the crack was still glowing faintly. Emma’s eyes widened further when she noticed the crack.

“Stella, your pendant is cracked... and glowing\!” Emma exclaimed, her voice filled with concern.

Stella looked down at the pendant, her heart racing. “I know. I don’t understand what’s happening.”

Emma stared at the pendant, then back at Stella. “Do you think it has something to do with why you’ve been feeling so strange lately?”

Stella took a deep breath, feeling the weight of her friend’s concern. “I don’t know. My mom insisted I always wear it. Maybe she might have some answers.”

Emma nodded. “You should call her.”

Stella pulled out her phone and dialed her mother’s number, her hands trembling slightly. After a few rings, her mother answered.

“Hi, sweetie\! How’s your day going?” her mother’s warm voice came through the phone.

“Mom, something’s wrong with the pendant,” Stella said, trying to keep her voice steady. “It’s cracked and glowing, and I’ve been feeling strange lately.”

There was a pause on the other end of the line before her mother spoke again, her tone more serious. “Stella, listen to me carefully. The pendant is very important. It was meant to protect you. If it’s cracked and glowing, it means your powers are starting to manifest.”

“My powers?” Stella repeated, confused. “What are you talking about?”

“I didn’t want to overwhelm you, but our family has a special lineage. The pendant was supposed to suppress your powers until you were ready. If it’s cracked, it means the suppression is failing,” her mother explained.

Stella felt a mix of fear and curiosity. “What do I do, Mom?”

“Come home immediately. We need to talk about this in person. I’ll explain everything,” her mother said urgently.

“Okay, I’ll come home right now,” Stella agreed.

After hanging up, Stella turned to Emma. “My mom said the pendant was meant to suppress my powers. She wants me to come home so she can explain everything.”

Emma stared at Stella, her skepticism clear. “Powers? Stella, are you serious?”

Stella nodded, feeling the weight of her mother’s words. “I know it sounds crazy, but that’s what she said.”

Emma glanced at the glowing crack in the pendant, her skepticism wavering. “Well, if the pendant is glowing like that, maybe there’s something to it. Let’s go.”

Stella nodded, feeling a mix of fear and determination. “Okay, let’s skip the rest of the classes and go.”

Stella and Emma hurried back to the dorms, their minds racing with the information they had just received. Stella's pendant continued to pulse with a faint glow, reminding her that this was no ordinary situation. As they approached the parking lot, Stella pulled out her keys and headed towards her old 1996 Jeep Wrangler.

The Jeep, a gift from her mom for graduating high school, had seen better days. Its faded blue paint was chipped in places, and there were a few dents and scratches, but it was reliable and held a lot of memories. Stella unlocked the doors, and they both climbed in, the worn leather seats creaking under their weight.

“Ready?” Stella asked, turning the key in the ignition. The engine roared to life, and she felt a sense of comfort in the familiar sound.

“Ready,” Emma replied, fastening her seatbelt.

As they pulled out of the parking lot, Emma glanced at the pendant again, still visibly concerned. “Do you think your mom will really have answers?”

“I hope so,” Stella said, her grip tightening on the steering wheel. “She’s always been a bit mysterious about our family, but she wouldn’t have told me to come home if it wasn’t important.”

They drove in silence for a while, the hum of the engine and the sound of the tires on the road filling the space between them. The drive to Stella’s home wasn’t long, but it felt like an eternity with the weight of uncertainty hanging over them.

Finally, they pulled into the driveway of a modest, cozy house with a well-kept garden. Stella’s mom was already waiting on the porch, her expression a mix of worry and determination. She hurried down the steps as soon as she saw the Jeep.

“Stella, Emma, come inside quickly,” she urged, her eyes flicking nervously to the glowing pendant around Stella’s neck.

They followed her into the house, the familiar scent of home calming Stella’s nerves slightly. Once inside, her mom led them to the living room and gestured for them to sit.

“Mom, what’s going on?” Stella asked, unable to keep the fear out of her voice.

Her mom took a deep breath and sat across from them. “Stella, there’s a lot you need to know. Our family has a unique lineage, one that comes with certain... abilities. The pendant was meant to suppress your powers until you were ready to handle them.”

Emma, now trying to process everything, leaned in. “Abilities? What kind of abilities?”

Stella’s mom nodded. “Our ancestors were Phoenixes, beings with the power to harness the element of fire. The pendant was crafted to keep those powers in check until the time was right.”

Stella stared at her mom, her mind racing. “This can’t be real. Phoenixes? Powers? Mom, are you going crazy?”

Her mom shook her head, her expression serious. “I know it sounds unbelievable, but it’s the truth. The pendant is cracked and glowing because your powers are starting to manifest.”

Emma looked at Stella, her concern now mixed with awe.

Stella took a deep breath, feeling the warmth of the pendant against her skin. “I don’t know. This sounds like something out of a fantasy novel. Mom, how can any of this be real?”

Her mom reached out and took Stella’s hand. “I understand it’s a lot to take in, but our family has a long history with these powers. Let me show you.”

With that, Stella’s mom opened her other hand, and a small flame danced in her palm. The fire flickered gently, casting a warm glow. Stella and Emma watched in stunned silence as the flame slowly smoldered out, leaving no trace.

Stella’s eyes widened in disbelief. “That... that was real. You really have powers.”

Her mom nodded. “And so do you, sweetie. We need to train you to control them before they become too strong to handle.”

Stella felt a mix of fear and disbelief. “So, what do we do now?”

Her mom's expression turned serious, a hint of fear in her eyes. “We start with understanding your powers and learning how to control them. But, Stella, you need to know this is not just about learning to control your powers. As the last of our kind, there are people out there who will want to capture or kill you because of your abilities. We have to be extremely careful.”

Stella felt a chill run down her spine. “So, it's not just about powers... It's about survival? Why would people want to come after me?”

Her mom sighed deeply. “Because your abilities are incredibly rare and powerful. Some people believe that by capturing a Phoenix, they can gain your powers or use them for their own purposes. Others fear what you can do and will want to eliminate you to protect themselves.”

Stella’s heart pounded as she tried to process her mom’s words. “So, it’s not just about learning to control my powers. It’s about staying safe from people who want to use or harm me.”

Her mom nodded. “Yes, and that’s why it’s so important that we do this right. It’s going to be challenging, but I’ll be here with you every step of the way.”

She paused, her expression growing even more serious. “Stella, did anyone else see the pendant glowing or notice anything unusual about you?”

Stella shook her head. “No, just Emma. We left class as soon as it started getting worse.”

Her mom sighed in relief. “Good. We need to keep this as quiet as possible for now. The fewer people who know, the safer you’ll be.”

Emma, now fully understanding the gravity of the situation, squeezed Stella’s hand. “We’ll figure this out together.”

Stella nodded, still feeling overwhelmed but also determined. “Okay, let’s do this.”

As they sat together, discussing the next steps, Stella couldn’t help but feel that her life had just taken a dramatic turn. She glanced at Emma, who gave her an encouraging smile, and knew that no matter what lay ahead, she wouldn’t have to face it alone.
